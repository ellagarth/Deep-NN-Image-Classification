#Deep-NN-Image-Classification

Python code using fully connected deep neural networks to correctly classify images.

Includes options to easily modify the number of hidden layers, learning rate, epochs, activation functions, etc. Includes numerous additional options to prevent over-fitting, including early stopping.

Requires PyTorch, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, and more libraries (see FullyConnected_NN_model.py).

Running FullyConnected_NN_model.py will print the loss value for every 100 epochs, generate a plot of loss over time/epoch for the training model, and a confusion matrix for the test images.

ALL IMAGES FOLDER CONTAINS: 22 x circles, 22 x squares, 22 x triangles, 22 x crosses. 
TRAINING IMAGE FOLDER CONTAINS: 18 x circles, 18 x squares, 18 x triangles, 18 x crosses, 1 x training.csv file for supervised learning TEST IMAGE FOLDER CONTAINS: 4 x circles, 4 x squares, 4 x triangles, 4 x crosses, 1 x test.csv file
